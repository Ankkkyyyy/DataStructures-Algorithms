    "\n",
    "The method takes in a parameter value, which is the value to be removed from the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first few lines of the method initialize a variable head to point to the head of the linked list, and then check if the linked list is empty. If it is, then there is nothing to remove, so the method simply returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the method checks if the head node of the linked list has the same value as the value parameter. If it does, then the head node is removed by updating the head to point to the next node in the list, and then setting the old head to None.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the method uses a while loop to iterate through the linked list to find the node with the specified value. If it finds the node, it breaks out of the loop, leaving the variable head pointing to the node with the specified value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the while loop completes without finding the node with the specified value, then head will be None, indicating that the value was not found in the linked list. In this case, the method simply returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the while loop does find the node with the specified value, the method updates the next pointer of the previous node to point to the node after the current node, effectively removing the current node from the linked list. Then the current node is set to None. Finally, the method completes by returning."
